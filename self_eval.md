# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code? *Using a `conditional` is useful if one needs different types of outputs based on the input. This allows programmers to control what the program does.*
2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently? *I honestly wouldn't do much differently. I felt very confident going through this assignment. I wish I would've written down more of my though process as I was working through some of the challenges.*
3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why? *It feels so good to naturally think back on some of the things I learned in class without doing additional research or digging in notes while problem solving. This validates that I'm learning pretty fast and understand the concepts in Mod0.*
